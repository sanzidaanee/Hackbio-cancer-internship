## Introduction

Lung adenocarcinoma represents a histopathological subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has various forms, such as solid, acinar, lepidic, papillary, and micropapillary subtypes [1]. This subtype comprises nearly half of all lung cancer cases [2]. It originates from the glandular epithelial cells that line the alveoli of the lungs and is characterized by the formation of glandular structures or mucin production[3].

It has many risk factors, including smoking, air pollution, genetic predisposition, occupational hazards, and exposure to substances such as silica, asbestos, diesel exhaust, and heavy metals [4]. In the recent advancements of bioinformatics, novel approaches have been developed for identifying potential drug targets for this cancer subtype [5].

## Dataset

The lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the 3 lung tumors studied by The Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA) through its lung cancer research. By June 2015, 521 LUAD samples had been analyzed, and the data had been uploaded to the TCGA data portal. A subset of 230 tumors was the subject of the TCGA lung cancer report for LUAD [6]. 


### Download data

TCGAbiolinks is an R/Bioconductor package designed to facilitate the retrieval, analysis, and integration of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other Genomic Data Commons (GDC) resources.


### Data type

The query searches the  TCGA-LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma) dataset with open-access RNA-seq gene expression data using  STAR - Counts refers to the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) alignment method, which is a popular tool for aligning RNA-Seq reads to a reference genome and pulls raw reads counts from primary tumor tissue (tumor) and solid tissue normal (normal tissue adjacent to the tumor). 

## Data Preprocessing

### Step 1: Create metadata

Metadata is important for exploring and making meaningful insights from the large dataset. Choose metadata based on race, tumor type, sample type and id.


### Step 2: Downsize data set

20 select for primary tumor and 20 for Solid Tissue Normal data

### Step 3: Data normalization and filtering


#### Data Normalization

- Normalization in RNA-Seq data is used to adjust raw read counts to account for various biases and ensure that gene expression levels can be accurately compared across different samples.

- The gene length normalization method is used to account for the fact that genes have different lengths, and longer genes are more likely to have higher read counts simply because there is more of the gene to be sequenced. 
- To ensure that the observed RNA-Seq counts reflect actual expression levels rather than just gene length, normalization by gene length adjusts the raw counts to account for these differences.


#### Filtering

- Filtering is important to filter out low-expressed genes from a normalized gene expression matrix. The quantile filtering method works by calculating a specified quantile threshold for the gene expression data and removing genes with expression values below this threshold.

- In this case, quantile cut off value 0.25 means that the bottom 25% of genes with the lowest expression values across all samples will be removed as they are likely to be noise or irrelevant to the analysis.

## Methods for Biomarker Discovery


### Differential Expression Analysis


Differential expression analysis is a fundamental technique used to identify changes in gene expression between different biological conditions like healthy or diseased situations. By analyzing the RNA-seq data can identify the up and down regulated genes that respond to specific conditions or treatments [7]. 

When the upregulated and downregulated genes are expressed in tumor or healthy cells indicate that if a gene is expressed in a cancer cell but not in healthy normal tissue, then that gene can be used as a potential biomarker to detect early cancer and drugs can be identified to target that gene.


### Functional Enrichment Analysis

Enrichment analysis is used to identify biological pathways, gene sets or functional categories in a given set of genes that are associated with specific types of cancer. 

Generate a bar plot to visualize the results of a functional enrichment analysis, focusing on biological processes, cellular components, molecular functions, and pathways associated with upregulated and downregulated genes. It shows the top 5 enriched GO terms (Biological Processes, Cellular Components, Molecular Functions) and pathways for a set of genes using the TCGA data. 

By identifying pathways related to the biological process of cancer help to find a potential biomarker that can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, or therapeutic targets [8].


## Results and Visualization

### Differentially Expressed Genes  (DEGs)


- DEGs were identified using a t-statistical test, setting a significance level of 1%. The log2 fold change (FC) was calculated with cutoff 1 and >1 for upregulation and <   -1 for downregulation. 

- From this analysis, 3277 upregulated genes and 6357 downregulated genes were extracted from a raw extracted dataset. 
- A volcano plot was created to visualize these results, showing how highly differentially  genes were expressed based on fold changes and p values. So, the volcano plot would show genes up-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma on the right side (e.g., cancer-associated genes), while those down-regulated in the cancer state appear on the left side.

- A heatmap shows patterns of gene expression across tumor and normal solid tissue. Each row indicates a specific gene and each column represents a different sample of tumor and normal tissues. The color shows expression levels like  red shows higher expression levels; upregulated, whereas blue indicates low-level of expression.    


- The results of  heatmap reveal the tumor and normal solid tissue samples clustering separately on both sides of the heatmap suggest a strong differential gene expression between two conditions. Genes that are expressed at higher levels in tumor tissues appear red in the tumor column and blue in normal tissue and these genes  might be involved in cancer progression or oncogenic processes. 

- On the other hand,  Genes that are expressed at lower levels in tumor tissues will appear blue in tumor columns and red in normal tissue columns may be a tumor suppressor gene.


So, identifying the key genes that are consistently differentially expressed between tumor and normal tissues, can be used as potential biomarkers for diagnosis or prognosis.

## Functional Enrichment Analysis

- Functional enrichment analysis was conducted on differentially expressed genes from lung cancer samples, revealing significant enrichment of several key biological processes. 

- In upregulated genes, the top three GO biological process are included behavior,  cell adhesion and biological adhesion and their upregulation is highly relevant in lung cancer because these mechanisms enable tumor cells to become invasive, migrate to distant sites, and ultimately lead to metastasis which is a major cause of lung cancer mortality.

- In lung adenocarcinoma, top enrichment of pathways for upregulated genes are  agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, and granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis reflects the tumor's ability to manipulate the immune system and promote an inflammatory microenvironment conducive to cancer progression. G-protein coupled receptor signaling  plays a critical role in tumor survival, proliferation, and metastasis. 


- On the other hand, in cases of down regulated genes, the  top biological processes are cell-cell signaling, nuclear division, and mitosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) indicates disruptions in key regulatory pathways that control cellular communication, cell division, and proliferation. 

- Top enrichment pathways are inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases and  downregulation of this inhibitors allows for increased tumor invasion and metastasis , intrinsic prothrombin activation pathway closely linked to tumor microenvironment and genes involved in this pathway cell cycle control of chromosomal replication pathway leads to genomic instability, enabling the accumulation of mutations that drive lung cancer progression.
